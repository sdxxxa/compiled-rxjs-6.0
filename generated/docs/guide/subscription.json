A Subscription has one important method, <code>unsubscribe</code>, that takes no argument and just disposes the resource held by the subscription. In previous versions of RxJS, Subscription was called \"Disposable\".</p>\n<code-example language=\"ts\">\nimport { interval } from 'rxjs';\n\nconst observable = interval(1000);\nconst subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n// Later:\n// This cancels the ongoing Observable execution which\n// was started by calling subscribe with an Observer.\nsubscription.unsubscribe(); \n</code-example>\n<p><span class=\"informal\">A Subscription essentially just has an <code>unsubscribe()</code> function to release resources or cancel Observable executions.</span></p>\n<p>Subscriptions can also be put together, so that a call to an <code>unsubscribe()</code> of one Subscription may unsubscribe multiple Subscriptions. You can do this by \"adding\" one subscription into another:</p>\n<code-example language=\"ts\">\nimport { interval } from 'rxjs';\n\nconst observable1 = interval(400);\nconst observable2 = interval(300);\n\nconst subscription = observable1.subscribe(x => console.log('first: ' + x));\nconst childSubscription = observable2.subscribe(x => console.log('second: ' + x));\n\nsubscription.add(childSubscription);\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  // Unsubscribes BOTH subscription and childSubscription\n  subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, 1000);\n</code-example>\n<p>When executed, we see in the console:</p>\n<code-example language=\"none\">\nsecond: 0\nfirst: 0\nsecond: 1\nfirst: 1\nsecond: 2\n</code-example>\n<p>Subscriptions also have a <code>remove(otherSubscription)</code> method, in order to undo the addition of a child Subscription.</p>\n\n</div>\n<!-- links to this doc:\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n-->"
